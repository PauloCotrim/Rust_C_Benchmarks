# Rust and C Benchmarks
Rust is a statically-typed programming language developed for efficiency and safety, particularly in concurrency and memory safety. The popularity of Rust programming has increased over the last couple years because it was claimed to provide comparable speed to C/C++. This repo collect the macro benchmarks and the performance benchmarks that are both implemented in Rust and C from open-sourced third-parties to compare the run-time performance objectively.
